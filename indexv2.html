<p id="Hannahtext"> Hi! I'm Hannah and I go to the Spence school, an all girls school in NYC. I am passionate about community service and computer science. Over the past 2 summers I have volunteered with Go Project, and Summer Steps, two non profit educational organizations that serve at risk kids. In school, I am a head of the hospital oureach club. We play with younger kids who lack social opportunities due to their illnesses. I started searching for community service opportunities freshman year. I spent hours wandering on google struggling to find an organization that suited my interests and offered positions to highschool students. I was overwhelemed by the vastness of the internet and the endless posibilities. I created this website in order to make the volunteer - finding process less intimidating and easier to navigate.</p>
